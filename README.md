> The AI-Generated web.

Append any url to the base url (after /, minus protocol) and it will live-stream generate the specific page!. After, your browser uses it again to recursively generate a site, including all assets, pages, and js! Uses [https://ai.hackclub.com](https://ai.hackclub.com) internally.

## Why?

To show that 2-shot vibecoding a webpage is not a good idea ðŸ’€

## Security

The CSP disallows all external assets, and the AI has been prompted to follow Hackclub Nest's CoC.

## Demo
